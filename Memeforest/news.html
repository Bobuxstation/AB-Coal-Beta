Memeforest lore and iceberg 1.0

 

The whole lore:
A memer was testing fall damage but he got into coma.
His coma has a dream that makes everything he wants come true.
so in the coma he packed and ride a plane to japan because retro gaming is his dream. 

 

In the memeforest island:
but his plane got shot down and fell down to the memeforest island.
After he was introduced to memeforest island he thought that the bad side 
of memeforest island (grubhub empire or bad memes empire) is the one that
shot his plane down but it wasn't. He prepared to attack by preparing the
tools and also helped my the good side of memeforest island (good memes village).
He successfully defeated the bad side of the memeforest island.
but the bad side didnt do anything bad because they dont have any weapons
that can shoot down a plane. So the king of the bad side took revenge 
like in the sequel of memeforest.

Who is the bad one?
But who actually shot down the plane? It was his own mind and
the good side used him to defeat the bad side.

Remains of the plane
The only remains of the plane that can be seen on the island is a computer.
The computer requires a recovery disc because the hard drive is missing.
The hard drive can be found by fishing and has 1 in 1000 chance and the
recovery disc is sold by bobux man (bobux man found the recovery disc in the beach).
The computer can unlock more recipe and used like normal computer.
This computer can unlock a lot of endings

Now the iceberg:

 

Entity:sprite_13
Sprite 13 is a creepypasta and has 1 in a million chance of 
being in your save file in the game it can give 13 and glitched
ending the lore says that it is trying to tell you that none of these are real

 

Item:item_47
Item 47 is a stick that can defeat anything in less than 1 second
But if its used to defeat the boss it the 64 bits guy will go crazy
and glitch the game untill it crashed one by one the chunk will get 
corrupted and has a 50% chance to spawn Sprite 13 on all memeforest
save. It is not recommended to use item 47

 

Hitbox
Hitbox was a transparent sprite that detects collisions and detect 
Interactive sprites now its not used anymore but still moves while being
invisible. It will not affect gameplay too much

 

Sequel 3
Sequel 3 doesn't exist in the plans and and all memeforest wiki
but it has sprite 13 in the game. The came is disturbing so it
 is not recommended to play it

 

Abandoned game maker project
There is a game maker edition of memeforest made as a joke from
the developers but the game is canceled

 

Taken from arkacraft islands
The color for the menu bar of memeforest is the same one as the
one in Arkacraft islands And some memeforest assets are added into
Arkacraft islands and it is a tree

 

Memeforest action figure
An action figure of memeforest player and villagers is a good idea.
 But it is forgotten

Unused sprites
There are some unused sprites in memeforest and some is in the lore

 

Cancelled logo
There was a logo where the meme letter for the logo is Minecraft 
villagers shaped as the letter meme instead of memeforest villagers

 

Disc
Disc is a weird music. But its not even a music some people say it's
sprite 13 recording but its just a sound of the memer in coma in the
hospital.

 

Kahonsol
The developers of memeforest made a gameconsole from phone and it run
game made from that developer it runs memeforest but the controls 
keeps stopping. Wierd
